# Pomdoro Timer

A pomodoro timer web app, with a simple and intuitive UI.

Built with Vuejs, Bootstrap, and Fontawesome.

A big thank you to Ashfaq Ahmed for his 'CSS Percentage Circle' [blog post](https://codeconvey.com/css-percentage-circle/). It served as the main inspiration for the percentage circle I have in the app.
